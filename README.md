# web_inventory_app

This test application has a user login and inventory form with camera 
integration!

This application is designed to make it easy for users to register inventory by
filling out a form and taking pictures with the device's camera. To use the 
application, users need to log in with their credentials.

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1.  Open the application and log in with your user credentials.
2.  Click on the button to fill out the inventory form.
3.  Fill out the form with the requested information and take pictures with the 
    device's camera.
4.  When you're done, click the submit button to send in your inventory.

The user can view all records, but only has the ability to update or delete 
heir own records. Other users' records are only available for viewing.

We believe this will make it easier for users to navigate the application and 
ensure that data updates are only made by authorized persons.
